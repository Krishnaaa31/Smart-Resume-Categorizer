# SmartResumeCategorizer

## Overview
A Resume Category Prediction App that automates the process of evaluating and filtering resumes based on predefined criteria. This application utilizes machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to extract, analyze, and score candidate information, helping recruiters identify the most relevant profiles efficiently.

## Features
- **Resume Parsing:** Automatically extracts key information such as skills, experience, and qualifications from resumes.
- **Category Prediction:** Classifies resumes into predefined categories based on job roles or industries.
- **Customizable Criteria:** Allows recruiters to define specific evaluation criteria for better matching.
- **Efficient Screening:** Streamlines the recruitment process by prioritizing relevant profiles.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simplifies interaction for non-technical users.

## Technologies Used
- **Streamlit:** For building an interactive web interface.
- **Python:** Core language for development.
- **Machine Learning:** Implements models for category prediction.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Powers resume parsing and analysis.
- **GitHub:** Version control and collaboration.
